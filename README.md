# SeedSigner SettingsQR Generator


## Quick Start
The SettingsQR Generator is just a bunch of static files that you can run in two different ways:

* Access the online hosted version at https://kdmukai.github.io/seedsigner-settings-generator/
* Or download the files yourself and run it in a completely offline web browser

### Download and run offline
If you prefer the offline method, get a local copy of this github repo by clicking on the green "code" button.

* If you have `git` installed, you can `git clone https://github.com/kdmukai/seedsigner-settings-generator.git`
* Or you can choose the "Download Zip" option

At this point you can disconnect your computer from the internet (or transfer the project files over to your air-gapped computer).

To run the SettingsQR Generator, just double-click on [docs/index.html](docs/index.html).
