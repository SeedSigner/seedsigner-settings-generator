# SeedSigner SettingsQR Generator


## Quick Start
The SettingsQR Generator is just a bunch of static web files that you can run in your browser two different ways:

### Access it online
The online hosted version is available at https://seedsigner.github.io/seedsigner-settings-generator/

### Download and run offline
You can run the SettingsQR Generator totally offline and air-gapped.

Get a local copy of this github repo by clicking on the green "code" button above.

* If you have `git` installed, you can `git clone https://github.com/seedsigner/seedsigner-settings-generator.git`
* Or you can choose the "Download Zip" option

At this point you can disconnect your computer from the internet (or transfer the project files over to your air-gapped computer).

To run the SettingsQR Generator, just double-click on docs/index.html.
